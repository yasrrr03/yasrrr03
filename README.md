- 👋 Hi, I’m @yasrrr03
- 👀 I’m interested in the tech space, specifically the AI/ML space though extremely interested in everything Back-End related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through some certifications on Dataquest and I hope to do my own projects soon; I am also learning Javascript with hands-on projects from Youtube.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects that will develop my skills in either language mentioned.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an avid football fan and proud Chelsea supporter since I was a young boy!
